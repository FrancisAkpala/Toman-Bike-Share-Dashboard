Power BI: For visualization and interactive dashboard creation.

Python (Optional): For advanced data preprocessing if necessary.

Deliverables

A functional Power BI dashboard with interactive visualizations.

ðŸ“Œ Recommendation
Pricing Strategy Recommendation for Toman Bike Share
After conducting an in-depth analysis of hourly revenue, profit and revenue trends, seasonal revenue, and rider demographics, we recommend a conservative price adjustment strategy to optimize revenue while maintaining customer retention.

Price Adjustment Analysis:
The current price in 2022 was $4.99.
A 10% increase would set the new price at approximately $5.49.
A 15% increase would set the new price at approximately $5.74.
Recommended Strategy:
Market Analysis:

Conduct further research on customer satisfaction, competitive pricing, and economic trends to determine the most sustainable increase.
Evaluate the impact of the new pricing on demand elasticity before full implementation.
Segmented Pricing Strategy:

Implement different pricing models for casual riders versus registered users, considering their price sensitivity and usage frequency.
Offer incentives such as discounts or loyalty programs for long-term subscribers.
Monitor and Adjust:

Gradually implement price changes and analyze customer feedback to avoid a decline in demand.
Use real-time sales data to track revenue impact and make necessary adjustments before finalizing the pricing strategy.
By following these recommendations, Toman Bike Share can achieve sustainable revenue growth while ensuring an optimal balance between profitability and customer retention. ðŸš´ðŸ’°

Final Version: Based on the complexity of data and analysis required.
